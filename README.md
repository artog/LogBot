# LogBot

A bot that connects warcraftlogs and discord, providing you with a link every time there is a new log for your guild. It also announces kills and, hopefully in the future, rankings of interest (95+).

The bot is written for Python 3.4 and uses [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) library for http traffic.
